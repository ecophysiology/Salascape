# Salascape
A mechanistic model for predicting salamander body temperature and energetics across landscapes

The following repository was created for a publication currently in revision.

The script iterates across ASCII files for each our of the day for each month of the year to calculate annual activity and energy balance. The simulation has been customized for a green salamander (Aneides aeneus). Each section contains a heading that describes the various components of the script, from libraries to simulations. The script was built using Python (version 3.8.3). The script generates ASCII files and a dataframe of summary statistics. Be sure to enter the correct path for your temperature data as well as the output paths for the results. The paths that require the user's attention have been labelled as your_path_here. Other attributes, such as body mass and thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate can be customized depending on the species.
